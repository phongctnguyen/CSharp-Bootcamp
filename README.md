## I. Data Types and Variables

### Data Type

- int, double, float
- char, string
- bool
- ...

### Variables

- Store a value, can be unassigned

### Coding Conventions

- [Coding-Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)

- Part of Coding Standrad

  + **Reasonable variable name -** While declaring a variable the developer has to give the variable a proper name. The name of the variable should be based on its use

  + **Proper function name -** A function should be given a name based on the functionality it does in the code or program

  + **Comments -** Functions should have comments which state the use and functionality of that function. It helps other developers working on the same project to understand the use of that function
  ```
  Single-Line Comments : //
  Multiline Comments: /* */
  XML Documentaion Comments (create documentation of function or class): ///
  ```

  + **Comments inside functions -** If there is something logical written inside the function which is very complex then the developer should mention what the code does in comments inside the function

  + **Developer Notes -** On the top of the class the developer can mention the use of a class, date of creation and other basic information

### Value and Reference Types

- [Types](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-value-type-and-reference-type)

- Value type

  + Value type as the name suggests is a data type which when declared and assigned a value, holds the *value directly on its own memory*

  + The value type uses a heap to store the value

  + Value types data types are int, float, char, bool ..

- Reference type

  + Reference type is a variable type which instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores the memory location of the actual data

  + The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data correctly

  + Reference type data types are string, class, Array...

  + When we copy this reference type of a data type it wil just copy the memory address of the data so we will then have two variable pointing to the same data


### Naming Conventions

- [Naming Convetions](https://www.dofactory.com/reference/csharp-coding-standards)

### String methods

- Concat()

- SubString(int32)

- ToLower()

- ToUpper()

- Trim()

- IndexOf(string)

- IsNullOrWhiteSpace()

- Format()
